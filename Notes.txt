What does the voxel engine need?

- Voxels
- Lighting
- State serialization and synchronization across a network
- Physics/collision detection
- AI features
- Dynamic objects

Also need these to make the game somewhat realistic:

- Terrain with interesting features
- Trees
- Vegetation
- Water
- Artificial structures

Other things players want:

- Creating anything
- Destroying everything
- Procedural generation
- Physical interactions on a per-voxel level
- Alternate simulations (anything else that interacts with voxel data, e.g. vegetation growth, door responses, “logic” like Minecraft’s redstone and pistons, and so on)
- Voxel characters
